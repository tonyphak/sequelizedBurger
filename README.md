# Burgers-4-life
## A Burger Eating Tracking App
Users will be able track their consumption of burgers. Users can add new burgers and choose which burgers to devour. The burgers are stored in a database queried using SQL.
## Motivation
I wanted to create an app that allowed users to store information to a SQL database through clientside UI.

## Getting Started
Full App can be found here [Burger Demo](https://stark-temple-90757.herokuapp.com/)

## Screenshots
Eat Da Burger - Users will be able to devour a list of burgers and they will also be able to enter new burgers
